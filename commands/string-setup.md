# String setup check

1. If the String tools are not available or report that sign-in is needed, tell the user to run
   `/mcp`, choose `string`, and sign in with their String account, then stop.
2. Read `https://example.com` with `web_access_fetch` and confirm Markdown comes back.
3. Run one `web_access_search` for a simple query and confirm the results carry `title`, `url` and
   `snippet`.
4. Report which tools responded. If both fail, the sign-in or the connection is likely the cause;
   suggest signing in again through `/mcp`. Report a partial failure tool by tool. Do not retry
   failures in a loop.

Keep it to a few lines. This is a connectivity check, not a demo.
